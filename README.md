I've split the frontend and backend into separate folders as I think this is what was causing the issue before we finished.
You may need to open the folders in different vscode projects -  we are writing to a file so it refreshes the vscode live server and causes a crash

to run
 - first you need to run `npm install` to install all packages in package.json
 - then run `npm run start` this should start your server on port 3000
